        "### Basic Decision Trees\n",
        "In a previous example (Build a Decision Tree Model), we learned how to build a single decision tree. One of the primary **problems** associated with decision trees, however, is that they are **prone to overfitting / high variance** (see this [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-trees-and-random-forests-df0c3123f991) for further information).\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic **reason for this** is has to do with the **depth of the tree** and how the increasing specificity of splits leads to a reliance on the training data that does not reflect the real world. The primary means of combating this is to reduce the depth (i.e. ```max_depth```), but this can, in turn, introduce bias problems that will be too generalized when confronted with unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ensemble Methods\n",
        "One means of combating the issues facing decision trees are to employ methods of ***building multiple trees** that can utilize information from each other to derive better models.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Random Forests vs. Gradient Boosting\n",
        "Both methods create multiple trees, but they take different approaches to combining that data. \n",
        "- **Random forests** use random samples of the data to create each new tree independent of any other tree. The results are then averaged to produce a final model.\n",
        "- **Gradient boosting** uses errors from previous trees to inform how each new tree is created in order to produce a \"best\" model.\n",

        "- **n_estimators** represents how many decision trees to be used. Remember that a high number of trees generally improves accuracy (up to a certain point) but will extend the model’s processing time. Above, I have selected 150 decision trees as an initial starting point. \n",
        "- **learning_rate** controls the rate at which additional decision trees influence the overall prediction. This effectively shrinks the contribution of each tree by the set learning_rate. Inserting a low rate here, such as 0.1, should help to improve accuracy. \n",
        "- **max_depth** defines the maximum number of layers (depth) for each decision tree. If “None” is selected, then nodes expand until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_leaf. Here, I have chosen a high maximum number of layers (30), which will have a dramatic effect on the final result, as we’ll soon see. \n",
        "- [**min_samples_split**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46480457/difference-between-min-samples-split-and-min-samples-leaf-in-sklearn-decisiontre) defines the minimum number of samples required to execute a new binary split. For example, min_samples_split = 10 means there must be ten available samples in order to create a new branch.\n",
        "- [**min_samples_leaf**](**min_samples_split**) represents the minimum number of samples that must appear in each child node (leaf) before a new branch can be implemented. This helps to mitigate the impact of outliers and anomalies in the form of a low number of samples found in one leaf as a result of a binary split. For example, min_samples_leaf = 4 requires there to be at least four available samples within each leaf for a new branch to be created. \n",
        "- **max_features** is the total number of features presented to the model when determining the best split.\n",
        "- **loss** calculates the model's error rate. For this exercise, we are using huber which protects against outliers and anomalies. Alternative error rate options include ls (least squares regression), lad (least absolute deviations), and quantile (quantile regression). Huber is actually a combination of least squares regression and least absolute deviations.\n",
